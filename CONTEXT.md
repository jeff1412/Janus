# JANUS — Project Context Document

> **Purpose:** This document provides comprehensive context for the JANUS Property Management System. Use it when working with external LLMs, onboarding developers, or as a reference for project decisions.

---

## 1. Project Overview

**JANUS** is a Property Management System that combines:

1. **n8n Workflows** — Backend automation that ingests repair/complaint emails, classifies them with AI, and routes them through workflows
2. **Next.js Web App** — Frontend dashboard for property managers, staff, and vendors to view and manage tickets, buildings, and users

The system handles **repair requests** and **complaints** from residents/owners/agents, classifies them (initial vs. follow-up, repair vs. complaint vs. condo_reject vs. general_inquiries), and creates/updates tickets in a database.

---

## 2. What We're Building (n8n Workflows)

### 2.1 JANUS - Starting Line (Email Ingestion)

- **Trigger:** IMAP email read (Property Connect inbox)
- **AI Agent:** Analyzes incoming emails and determines if they contain **single** or **multiple** repair issues
  - **Single issue:** Copies entire email body to `Focus_Issues_in_Email`
  - **Multiple issues:** Extracts each issue separately and calls the tool multiple times
- **Tool:** `process_repair_request` — Calls **JANUS - Judgement Workflow** for each issue

**Tool input schema:**
```json
{
  "senderEmail": "Email address of the person sending the repair request",
  "senderName": "Full name of the sender",
  "subject": "Email subject line",
  "date": "Timestamp when email was received",
  "attachments": "Array of attachment information",
  "original_email_body": "Complete original email body",
  "Focus_Issues_in_Email": "The specific issue(s) — same as original_email_body if single issue"
}
```

### 2.2 JANUS - Judgement Workflow (Main Router)

**Flow summary:**

1. **Execute Trigger** — Receives data from Starting Line or direct execution
2. **Process attachments Code** — Normalizes data from orchestrator or IMAP (maps `Focus_Issues_in_Email` → `body`, etc.)
3. **Select Owner Resident Agent emails** — PostgreSQL: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1 AND role IN ('Owner', 'Resident', 'Agent')`
4. **If owner resident or agent** — Routes only if sender is a known resident/owner/agent
5. **Initial / Not Initial Agent** — AI classifies email as `initial` (new request) or `not_initial` (follow-up)
6. **Switch: Initial or Not Initial Email**
   - **Initial** → Main Router Agent
   - **Not Initial** → Extract Ticket ID, then route to existing ticket or unified workflow

7. **Main Router Agent** — Classifies:
   - `is_building_responsibility`: true/false
   - `type`: `repair` | `complaint` | `condo_reject` | `general_inquiries_or_redesign`
   - Building type (rental vs condo) affects routing — rental never gets `condo_reject`

8. **Building Responsibility?** — If true → Repair or Complaint; if false → Condo Reject or General Inquiries

9. **Repair route** → Repair Preparation → **JANUS - Repair Main WorkFlow**
10. **Complaint route** → Complaint Preparation → Complaint workflow
11. **Not Initial** → Extract Ticket ID from subject/body (`ticket-XXXXXXXX`), lookup ticket, route to appropriate workflow

**Referenced sub-workflows:**
- `JANUS - Repair Main WorkFlow`
- `JANUS - Unified Not Initial workflow Without Ticket Id`
- `JANUS - Complaint Workflow` (implied from docs)

### 2.3 Database Tables (Inferred from n8n)

| Table          | Key Fields |
|---------------|------------|
| `users`       | `email`, `role` (Owner, Resident, Agent, PropertyManager), `building_id`, `name`, `suite_number` |
| `buildings`   | `id`, `building_type` (condo/rental), `property_manager_email`, `property_manager_name` |
| `tickets`     | `ticket_id`, `state` (e.g. Completed), `building_id`, sender info, etc. |
| `vendors`     | `email`, etc. |
| `ticket_messages` | `ticket_id`, `sender_email`, `sender_name`, `body`, `is_internal`, `created_at` (conversation history for each ticket) |
| `building_rules`  | `building_id`, `ai_text`, `rule_category`, `effective_date` (AI-readable rules per building) |
| `smtp_settings`   | `building_id`, `host`, `port`, `username`, `password`, `is_default` (Dynamic SMTP config) |

**Ticket ID format:** `ticket-XXXXXXXX` (e.g. `ticket-1`, `ticket-123`)

## 6. TypeScript Types (`types/index.ts`)

**Supabase / Domain types:**

- `BuildingType`: `'condo' | 'rental' | 'housing-co-op'`
- `UserRole`: `'Resident' | 'Owner' | 'Agent' | 'PropertyManager'`
- `TicketType`: `'repair' | 'complaint' | 'condo_reject' | 'general_inquiries_or_redesign'`
- `TicketState`: `'new' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'pending-approval'`
- `TicketUrgency`: `'low' | 'medium' | 'high'`
- `VendorType`: `'vendor' | 'contractor'`

**Interfaces:** `Building`, `User`, `Vendor`, `Ticket`, `TicketMessage`, `BuildingRule`, `AuthUser`

- `TicketMessage` maps to the `ticket_messages` table (per-ticket conversation history, including `is_internal` notes).
- `BuildingRule` maps to a `building_rules` table (AI-readable building rules and categories).
- `AuthUser` represents the authenticated Supabase user + basic profile/role fields used by the app.

**Note:** `lib/mock-data.ts` uses different types (`admin`, `staff`, `vendor` roles; `TicketStatus`, `Urgency`) — these are for mock data only. Real Supabase data should align with `types/index.ts`.

## 7. Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1 — Supabase Setup

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Run SQL to create tables (tickets, users, buildings, etc.) | ✅ Done |
| Run SQL to insert seed/test data | ✅/⭕ Depends on what was run |
| Create test user in Supabase Auth | ✅ Done |

### Phase 2 — Connect Code to Supabase

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Add `.env.local` with Supabase keys | ✅ Done |
| Create `lib/supabase.ts` client | ✅ Done |
| Create `types/index.ts` with interfaces | ✅ Done |

### Phase 3 — Auth

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Replace login page with Supabase Auth | ✅ Done (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`) |
| Add middleware for protected routes | ⭕ Not done (middleware disabled) |
| Add role detection + redirect based on role | ⭕ Partially done (role stored in Supabase user metadata and read via `useAuthUser`, but no per-role redirects yet) |

### Phase 4 — Real Data in Pages

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Dashboard real ticket counts | ✅ Done (Supabase `tickets` table) |
| Tickets list page real tickets | ✅ Done (Supabase `tickets` table + filters) |
| Ticket detail page real ticket + history | ✅ Done (ticket from Supabase `tickets`; conversation from `ticket_messages`; managers can change state and assign vendors from `vendors`) |
| Admin page real buildings + users | ✅ Done (Supabase `users` + `buildings` tables) |

### Phase 5 — Ticket Submission

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| New Ticket form + insert into Supabase | ✅ Done (`/dashboard/tickets/new` inserts into `tickets`) |

### Phase 6 — Email Intake & Automation

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Email intake API (`/api/email-intake`) | ✅ Done (AI classification + initial message) |
| Multi-vendor auto-assignment | ✅ Done (based on category + building) |
| Dynamic SMTP Configuration | ✅ Done (Admin UI + `smtp_settings` table) |
| Real SMTP Notification Delivery | 🟡 In Progress |

**Summary:** Basic Supabase login + protected dashboard is working. The email intake motor is functional with AI classification and dynamic SMTP routing. Next major focus is the transition to live email triggers and multi-tenant company hierarchy.

## 8. Auth Flow (Current)

1. **Root (`/`)** → Redirects to `/login`
2. **Login (`/login`)** → Form calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` → On success, `window.location.href = '/dashboard'`
3. **Dashboard layout** → `useEffect` checks `supabase.auth.getSession()`; if no session → redirect to `/login`. Also subscribes to `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()` to redirect if the user signs out or the session is lost.
4. **Logout** (Sidebar) → Calls `supabase.auth.signOut()` and then redirects to `/login`

**Middleware:** `middleware.disabled.ts` exists with cookie-based session check but is **disabled** (file renamed). When re-enabled, it would protect routes server-side.

## 9. Key Code Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lib/supabase.ts` | Supabase client; uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` |
| `app/login/page.tsx` | Login form, Supabase Auth |
| `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` | Auth check, Sidebar, wraps all dashboard pages |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Stats cards + recent tickets (Supabase `tickets`) |
| `app/dashboard/tickets/page.tsx` | Ticket list with status/urgency filters (Supabase `tickets`) |
| `app/dashboard/tickets/new/page.tsx` | New ticket form that inserts into Supabase `tickets` |
| `app/dashboard/tickets/[id]/page.tsx` | Ticket detail + Supabase-backed conversation thread (`ticket_messages`) and vendor assignment (`vendors`) |
| `app/dashboard/buildings/page.tsx` | Buildings grid (mock data from `lib/mock-data.ts`) |
| `app/dashboard/vendors/page.tsx` | Vendors list (mock users filtered as vendors from `lib/mock-data.ts`) |
| `app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx` | Users + Buildings + SMTP Settings tabs |
| `app/api/email-intake/route.ts` | AI Triage + Ticket Creation + Dynamic Notifications |
| `app/hooks/useAuthUser.ts` | Client hook that loads the authenticated Supabase user as an `AuthUser` (including `role`) |
| `components/sidebar.tsx` | Nav links; logout handler |
| `lib/mock-data.ts` | Mock users, buildings, tickets |

---

## 10. Routing & Sidebar

**Actual routes (Next.js App Router):**

- `/` → redirect to `/login`
- `/login` → Login page
- `/dashboard` → Dashboard home
- `/dashboard/tickets` → Tickets list
- `/dashboard/tickets/[id]` → Ticket detail
- `/dashboard/buildings` → Buildings
- `/dashboard/vendors` → Vendors
- `/dashboard/admin` → Admin (users + buildings)

**Sidebar hrefs:** Use `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/tickets`, `/dashboard/buildings`, `/dashboard/vendors`, `/dashboard/admin`, matching the App Router structure. Active state is based on `usePathname()` and `startsWith(href)` for non-root dashboard links.

---

## 11. Environment Variables

Required in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

---

## 12. Data Flow (Target State)

1. **n8n** ingests emails → AI classifies → Creates/updates tickets in Postgres (Supabase)
2. **Next.js app** reads tickets, buildings, users from Supabase
3. **Property managers** view dashboard, tickets, assign vendors, update status
4. **Residents** (future) may submit tickets via form or email

---

## 13. Next Steps (Suggested)

1. Re-enable and fix middleware for protected routes so auth is enforced server-side (in addition to the client-side dashboard layout check).
2. Finish role-based behavior: use `useAuthUser` / Supabase user metadata to redirect by role and gate features (e.g. only PropertyManagers can assign vendors or change ticket state).
3. Replace remaining mock data in `buildings` and `vendors` pages with Supabase-backed tables and CRUD flows.
4. Integrate n8n workflows so email replies and automation steps write into the `ticket_messages` table, keeping the in-app conversation thread in sync with email.
5. Add basic admin UIs for creating/editing/deleting buildings, users, and vendors behind the Admin tab.
